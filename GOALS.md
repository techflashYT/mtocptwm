- [x] broacasts info about the current setup to a multicast address so that the rest of the LAN can find it
  - [x] name
  - [x] IP address
  - [ ] port number of server (NOTE: there is no acutal server yet to send the port number of)
  - [ ] config
- [ ] has a config file that can be shared in the discovery process
  - [ ] stores the layout of the virtual monitors
  - [ ] designed in a way that is easily expandable

    - [ ] Nintendo Wii
    - [ ] Nintendo Switch
- [ ] uses some method to grab any windows on the virtual monitors.  Must work cross platform
- [ ] transfer any windows on the virtual monitors to the respective IP address and port
  - [ ] IP & Port are from the loaded config
  - [ ] uses an MPEGTS stream
  - [ ] ONLY transfer the parts of the window that exist on the monitor, in such a way that if a window is split halfway between 2 monitors, it will only transfer what is necessary.
